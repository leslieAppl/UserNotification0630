# User Notification

## Local User Notification

## The provisional notifications - the quiet notifications
### Only show in the Notification Center (they are not displayed in the Locked or Home screens) and inclued buttons for the user to decide whether to keep them or turn them off.
### To get the app to post provisional notifications, all we have to do is to add the provisional option to the requestAutorization() method.
